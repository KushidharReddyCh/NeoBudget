        I have attached my monthly income and expense budget, along with my credit card transaction history for the last [Number] months. Please analyze this data to identify:
        1.  **Key spending categories:** What are the top 5-10 categories where I spend the most money?
        2.  **Income vs. Expenses:** What is my average monthly income, total expenses, and savings rate (or deficit)?
        3.  **Spending trends:** Are there any noticeable increases or decreases in spending within specific categories over the past [Number] months?
        4.  **Potential areas for savings:** Based on my spending patterns, where could I potentially reduce expenses without significantly impacting my essential needs or stated priorities (if you can infer any)? Please provide specific examples or types of spending to consider.
        5.  **Discretionary vs. Non-Discretionary Spending:** Can you help me understand the breakdown between essential (non-discretionary) and non-essential (discretionary) spending?
        6.  **Credit card usage:**
            * What is my average credit card balance and utilization rate?
            * Are there any recurring credit card charges that I might be able to optimize or eliminate?
            * Am I incurring any late fees or interest charges? If so, how much on average?
        7.  **Budget adherence:** How well am I sticking to my stated budget (if the budget data is detailed enough for comparison)? Are there any significant variances?
        8.  **Recommendations:** Based on your analysis, what are 2-3 actionable steps I could take to improve my financial situation, whether it's increasing savings, reducing debt, or optimizing my spending?
